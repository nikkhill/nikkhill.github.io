I am a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University at the Language Technologies Institute. 
I love working on any kind of Artificial Intelligence application. Currently as a first year
Master's student I am learning Information Retrieval, Statistical NLP and Machine Learning.
I also work with [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze) on multimodal text summarization.
Prior to coming to CMU, I was working as a software engineer with J.P. Morgan Chase 
where I worked on some really cool NLP projects using deep learning. I also enjoy building UIs. 
Check out my Android apps and themes [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Nikhil+Bhale). 

I am looking for a AI/ML/Data Science summer internship for 2019. So if your company has an opening, please get in touch.
